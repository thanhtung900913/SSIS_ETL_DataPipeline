# **AdventureWorks 2022 ETL and Reporting Pipeline**

## **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates how to use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to build a complete data pipeline. The pipeline performs **Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)** operations on the AdventureWorks 2022 dataset provided by Microsoft. The processed data is stored in a **Data Warehouse**, and reports are created based on the cleansed and transformed data.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Data Extraction**: 
  - Data is sourced from the AdventureWorks 2022 database (OLTP system).
- **Data Transformation**:
  - Cleansing and transformation processes are applied to ensure data consistency and quality.
  - Business logic is implemented to structure the data for reporting purposes.
- **Data Loading**:
  - Transformed data is loaded into a structured **Data Warehouse** designed for analytics and reporting.
- **Reporting**:
  - Reports are built on the Data Warehouse using visualization tools to showcase actionable insights.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)**:
  - For designing and managing the ETL pipeline.
- **SQL Server**:
  - As the OLTP system for the AdventureWorks 2022 database.
  - For hosting the Data Warehouse.
- **AdventureWorks 2022 Dataset**:
  - Provided by Microsoft as the primary data source.
- **Reporting Tools**:
  - Power BI / SSRS (or any preferred visualization tool) for creating reports.

---

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Setup**:
   - Install SQL Server and restore the AdventureWorks 2022 sample database.
   - Configure SSIS for the project.
2. **ETL Process**:
   - **Extract**: Data is extracted from source tables in AdventureWorks.
   - **Transform**: Apply transformations, such as:
     - Data type conversions.
     - Data cleansing.
     - Aggregations and calculations for reporting metrics.
   - **Load**: Load the transformed data into the Data Warehouse.
3. **Data Warehouse Design**:
   - A star schema is created with fact and dimension tables.
   - Optimized for query performance and reporting.
4. **Reporting**:
   - Use reporting tools to visualize:
     - Sales performance.
     - Customer insights.
     - Product analysis.
5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Ensure data accuracy and consistency across the pipeline.
   - Validate reports for correctness and usability.

## **Getting Started**
### **Prerequisites**
- SQL Server 2019 or higher (including SSIS and SQL Server Management Studio).
- AdventureWorks 2022 sample database.
- A reporting tool (e.g., Power BI or SSRS).

### **Steps to Run the Project**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AdventureWorks-ETL-Pipeline.git
   ```
2. Set up the AdventureWorks 2022 database by restoring the `.bak` file.
3. Open the SSIS solution file in **SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)**.
4. Deploy the SSIS packages and execute the ETL process.
5. Verify that data is loaded into the Data Warehouse.
6. Open the reporting tool and connect to the Data Warehouse for creating and exploring reports.
